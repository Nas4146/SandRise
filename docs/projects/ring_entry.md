It stitches together Google Custom Search with direct ATS integrations, applies opinionated filters for title and location fit, and pushes ready-to-apply opportunities to me via iMessage and Slack before they hit the broader market.

## What It Delivers
- Near-real-time aggregation across Google CSE plus Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Workable, and Workday boards.
- Smart filters covering role title, geography, hybrid/remote preferences, and deduped canonical job keys.
- Multi-channel notifications with batching, rate limits, and sanity-check dry runs for fast iteration.
- Operational guardrails: rotating logs, quota-aware retries, and heartbeat state files for quick health checks.

## Coming Next
- Expand direct Workday coverage with richer per-company configuration and multilingual support.
- Ship lightweight metrics dashboard that surfaces per-source yield, latency, and skipped-reason trends without digging into logs.
- Automate post-alert workflow: auto-generate outreach snippets and sync accepted roles into an Airtable pipeline for follow-up tracking.
