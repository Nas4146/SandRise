# FlexEx – Portfolio Snapshot

## Product Narrative
FlexEx is a Gen Z-focused fitness companion that pairs instant AI-generated workouts with full live editing, so every session can be rearranged, swapped, or expanded on the fly. Designed as a modern product experience, it gives users Google/Apple sign-in, persistent history, and a card-based interface that feels as fluid as editing a playlist.

## Launch Status
- **Stage:** Pre-launch — production builds are ready and accessibility-compliant, with App Store submission queued after the latest build verifications.
- **Distribution Plan:** TestFlight-ready for targeted beta cohorts, with Firebase Remote Config controlling feature rollouts.
- **Platforms:** iOS and Android via a single Expo-managed React Native codebase.
