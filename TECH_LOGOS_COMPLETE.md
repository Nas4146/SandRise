## Usage in Components

Use the `<TechLogo>` component to display logos:

```astro
<TechLogo name="react" />
<TechLogo name="typescript" />
<TechLogo name="aws" />
<TechLogo name="vscode" />
```

The component automatically:
- Loads the SVG from `public/images/tech/{name}.svg`
- Provides consistent sizing and styling
- Handles accessibility with proper alt text

## Verification

To verify all logos are present:
```bash
ls -1 public/images/tech/*.svg | wc -l
# Should output: 46
```

To see file sizes:
```bash
ls -lh public/images/tech/
```

## Notes

- All logos are SVG format for crisp display at any size
- Logos maintain their official brand colors and styling
- Total collection size: ~260KB (most logos are very small)
- Segment logo is the largest at 180KB (consider optimizing if needed)
- TestFlight logo is smallest at 86 bytes

## Re-running Setup

If you need to re-download logos:

1. Simple Icons logos: `node copy-tech-logos.js`
2. Official brand logos: `./download-missing-logos.sh`

Both scripts are idempotent and safe to re-run.
