title: "AI Dev Agents — Windy platform"
summary: "AI-native developer workstation orchestrating autonomous coding agents, multi-tier storage, and progress-aware execution."
category: "Developer Tools"
role: "Product Manager & Product Builder"
timeline: "Ongoing"

metrics:
  - label: "Status"
    value: "Internal beta"
    hint: "Orchestrator MVP shippable"
  - label: "Storage"
    value: "JSON + Firestore"
    hint: "Multi-tier federation"
  - label: "Delivery"
    value: "CLI & API parity"
    hint: "Progress-aware execution"
problem: "Teams experimenting with AI coding agents lack orchestration, traceability, and shared storage. Windy unifies execution, reporting, and storage so humans always understand what agents did and why."
roleDetail: "Defined product requirements, architecture layers, and developer experience—from orchestrator design and storage federation to progress reporting and hybrid auth."
process:
  - title: "Agent orchestrator"
    description: "Built unified run manager that coordinates CLI, API, and background services while persisting execution state."
  - title: "Multi-tier storage"
    description: "Federated local JSON caches with Firestore adapters to keep agent history synced and queryable."
  - title: "Progress reporting"
    description: "Shipped structured status updates, SSE streams, and collaboration hooks for human-in-the-loop reviews."
outcomes:
  - "Regression suite validating execution record unification across storage tiers."
  - "Containerized execution path adopted by early design partners."
  - "GitHub Actions integration roadmap in place for smoke automation."
reflection: "Building agent platforms is about trust and transparency. Windy proves autonomous support works when orchestration, storage, and reporting stay in lockstep."
