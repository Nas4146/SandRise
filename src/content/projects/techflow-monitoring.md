title: "TechFlow â€” Unified operations monitoring"
summary: "Merged disparate alerting tools into a single command center so ops teams could spot customer-impacting issues in minutes."
category: "DevOps"
role: "Product Lead"
timeline: "7 months"
heroImage: "/images/logos/techflow.svg"
heroAlt: "TechFlow logomark"
impact: "-62% mean time to resolution"
tags:
  - Incident Response
  - Platform Ops
  - Observability
metrics:
  - label: "Alert fatigue"
    value: "-48%"
    hint: "Noisy alerts eliminated"
  - label: "MTTR"
    value: "-62%"
    hint: "Across priority incidents"
  - label: "Customer escalations"
    value: "-31%"
    hint: "First quarter post-launch"
problem: "Ops engineers bounced between six tools, delaying mitigation and forcing customer success to escalate too late in the cycle."
roleDetail: "Defined the integration roadmap, facilitated war-game exercises, and shaped the command center experience with design & ops."

  - title: "Journey mapping"
    description: "Ran retros with on-call engineers to map the fragmentation across tooling."
  - title: "Command center build"
    description: "Shipped a radar view of live incidents with ownership, runbooks, and status broadcasts."
  - title: "Operational readiness"
    description: "Instituted playbooks, alert budgets, and on-call reviews to sustain improvements."
outcomes:
  - "MTTR dropped 62% and escalations fell by a third."
  - "On-call teams reported 48% less alert fatigue."
  - "Customer success regained trust with proactive outreach."
reflection: "When signal is clean, teams can focus on mitigation not tooling. Next iteration integrates AI-assisted runbooks."
